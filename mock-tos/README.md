# Mock ToS Page
**N4N-0**

**Description**
This is just a mock ToS page I am creating to test my HTML, CSS, and Git skills.

**Challenges**
- Aligning the image and H1 side by side. 
- Removing text decoration from links
- Making the page responsive

**Solutions**
- I put the logo and h1 in a div. Changed the display to "Flex" and center aligned the items
- Google was my friend. I originally opted to use the button element in html however I wasnt able to remove the default styling. So I changed my method to a stylized link.
- I say its responsive because the text and logo scales with the screensize however, i wish I was able to make to it look better on smaller screensizes

**Things I would do better**
- Work harder to make the appearence better on smaller screens
- find away to make the cursor change when going over the button and not just the text
