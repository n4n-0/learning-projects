# Google Search Page Project
**N4N-0**

**Description**
I am currently going through the odin project along with FreeCodeCamp. I am using github to also utilize my git skills. This project is backwards engineered Google Search clone without functionality.

**Things I think are going to be challenging**
- Aligning things correctly using CSS
- Capturing Googles well known aesthetic 

**Things I hope to learn**
- How to better my skills using Chrome's Dev Tools
- Increase my git proficiency
