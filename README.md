# Small Learning Projects
**Description**
The point in these projects are to build my skills while I attend school and continue to learn new things. I originally had them all in there own repositories but I figured that would eventually become overwhelming. I intend to use github to keep track of all my progress and anything that I don't consider a big project will fall under this repo.
