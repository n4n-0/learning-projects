# Albert Einstein Tribute Page
**n4n-0**

**Description**
This is a tribute page created using html/css. Just another project to attempt to develop my skills further.

**Challenges**
- Rounding the image to a circle and correctly placing the image in the center

**Solutions**
- I placed the image in a div on top of the circle and hid the overflow and adjusted the position a little bit.

**Things I would do better**
- Try new skills. I think mine looks better than the espected outcome but I wished I would have used some css features I havent quite got familiar with yet.
